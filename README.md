# Math Test
This code uses TestNG to test a basic Math operation web page (https://antonregis.com/node/36).
  
An .xml file is used to run two separate java classes and generates a test report at the end of the test.

In the second java class, it was intentionally failed to demonstrate additional reporting in the status report. A bug was intentionally planted in the code to fail the test in division.
